## Description

A representation of 3D vectors and points.

<!-- USER CONTENT START --> description

vector3 is the most frequently used type in Infernux. It represents positions, directions, velocities, and scales in three-dimensional space. Every [Transform](Transform.md) stores its `position`, `rotation`, and `local_scale` as vector3 values, and physics, rendering, and animation systems all operate on them.

Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) work component-wise. Use `dot()` to measure alignment between two directions, `cross()` to compute perpendicular vectors (e.g., surface normals), and `project()` / `project_on_plane()` for projection.

Static direction constants — `forward` (0, 0, 1), `up` (0, 1, 0), `right` (1, 0, 0) — follow Infernux's left-hand coordinate system conventions.

## Example

<!-- USER CONTENT START --> example
```python
from Infernux.math import vector3

# Create positions
origin = vector3(0, 0, 0)
target = vector3(10, 5, 3)

# Direction and distance
direction = vector3.normalize(target - origin)
dist = vector3.distance(origin, target)

# Cross product — compute a surface normal from two edge vectors
edge_a = vector3(1, 0, 0)
edge_b = vector3(0, 1, 0)
normal = vector3.normalize(vector3.cross(edge_a, edge_b))

# Smooth movement toward a target
current = vector3(0, 0, 0)
current = vector3.lerp(current, target, 0.1)

# Use built-in direction constants
forward = vector3.forward   # (0, 0, 1)
up      = vector3.up         # (0, 1, 0)
```
