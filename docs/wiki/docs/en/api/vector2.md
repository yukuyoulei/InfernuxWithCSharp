## Description

A representation of 2D vectors and points.

<!-- USER CONTENT START --> description

vector2 represents a two-dimensional vector with `x` and `y` components. It is used for 2D positions, directions, UV coordinates, and screen-space calculations throughout the engine.

Supports standard arithmetic — add, subtract, multiply, and divide vectors or scale by a scalar. Utility methods provide common operations: `magnitude()` and `sqr_magnitude()` for length, `normalize()` for unit conversion, `dot()` for projection, `distance()` for spacing, `lerp()` for interpolation, and `angle()` for measuring rotation between directions.

Static constants like `vector2.zero`, `vector2.one`, `vector2.up`, and `vector2.right` give quick access to frequently used values without constructing new instances.

## Example

<!-- USER CONTENT START --> example
```python
from Infernux.math import vector2

# Construct vectors
pos = vector2(3.0, 4.0)
target = vector2(10.0, 0.0)

# Arithmetic
offset = vector2(target.x - pos.x, target.y - pos.y)
scaled = vector2(offset.x * 0.5, offset.y * 0.5)

# Length and distance
length = vector2.magnitude(pos)           # 5.0
dist = vector2.distance(pos, target)

# Normalize to a unit direction
direction = vector2.normalize(offset)

# Dot product and angle
dot = vector2.dot(pos, target)
angle = vector2.angle(pos, target)

# Smooth interpolation between two points
mid = vector2.lerp(pos, target, 0.5)
```
