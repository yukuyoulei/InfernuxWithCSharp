"""Deferred multi-frame task runner.

Allows long operations to be split into discrete steps that execute one per
frame, giving the status bar a chance to redraw between steps.

Example::

    runner = DeferredTaskRunner.instance()
    runner.submit("Play Mode", [
        ("Saving scene…",  0.2, save_fn),
        ("Rebuilding…",    0.6, rebuild_fn),
    ], on_done=lambda ok: print("Done", ok))
