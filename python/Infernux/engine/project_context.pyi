"""Project context — global project root and script-path resolution.

Provides the single source of truth for the currently-open project path
and helpers for resolving relative script paths (including ``.py → .pyc``
fallback in packaged builds).

Example::

    from Infernux.engine.project_context import set_project_root, resolve_script_path

    set_project_root("/path/to/project")
    abs_path = resolve_script_path("Assets/Scripts/player.py")
