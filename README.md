## Overview

Infernux is a from-scratch engine for developers who want control over the runtime, the editor workflow, and the scripting surface instead of treating the engine as a sealed product.

The project combines three layers:

- A native C++17 / Vulkan runtime for rendering, scene systems, physics, audio, and platform services.
- A pybind11 bridge that exposes the native runtime to Python.
- A Python layer for gameplay, editor tooling, content workflows, build automation, and render authoring.

The architectural goal is straightforward: keep the hot path native, keep iteration fast, and keep the codebase understandable enough that teams can extend it without reverse-engineering hidden policy.

## Current Scope

Infernux is currently a Windows-first technical preview. The project already contains a usable editor/runtime core, but it should still be evaluated as an actively evolving engine rather than a finished commercial platform.

Core capabilities available today include:

- Vulkan forward and deferred rendering, PBR, cascaded shadows, MSAA, shader reflection, and post-processing.
- RenderGraph and RenderStack APIs authored from Python.
- Jolt physics integration with rigidbodies, colliders, scene queries, callbacks, and layer filtering.
- GUID-based assets, dependency tracking, scene serialization, prefab workflows, and play-mode isolation.
- An integrated editor with Hierarchy, Inspector, Scene View, Game View, Project, Console, UI editing, and build settings.
- Python-side component lifecycle, coroutines, serialized fields, and script reload support.
- Basic runtime UI primitives including Canvas, Text, Image, Button, and pointer events.
- **2D animation (preview):** sprite `SpiritAnimator`, `AnimClip2D` assets, animation state machine assets, and editor panels for authoring. Expect breaking changes while the stack stabilizes.
- Packaging paths for the Hub, a standalone bundle, and a Windows installer.

## Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|:------|:---------------|
| C++17 / Vulkan | Rendering, resource ownership, scene systems, physics, audio, platform integration |
| pybind11 bridge | Native bindings exposed to Python |
| Python | Gameplay, editor logic, tooling, automation, render authoring |

This split keeps performance-sensitive systems in native code while leaving day-to-day production code in a language that is easier to iterate on and easier to connect to external tooling and data pipelines.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

| Dependency | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|
| Windows | 10 / 11 (64-bit) |
| Python | 3.12+ |
| Vulkan SDK | 1.3+ |
| CMake | 3.22+ |
| Visual Studio | 2022 (MSVC v143) |
| pybind11 | 2.11+ |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS</b></summary>

| Dependency | Version |
|:-----------|:--------|
| macOS | 12+ |
| Python | 3.12+ |
| Vulkan SDK | 1.3+ (LunarG SDK with MoltenVK) |
| CMake | 3.22+ |
| Ninja | 1.10+ |
| Xcode Command Line Tools | Latest |
| pybind11 | 2.11+ |

Install the Vulkan SDK from <https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home> and source the environment script after installation.

```bash
source ~/VulkanSDK/<version>/setup-env.sh
brew install cmake ninja
```

</details>

Any Python 3.12 environment works. The commands below use Conda because that is the most common workflow in this repository.

### Clone

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ChenlizheMe/Infernux.git
cd Infernux
```

If the repository was cloned without submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build

```bash
conda create -n infengine python=3.12 -y
conda activate infengine
pip install -r requirements.txt
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
```

On macOS, replace `release` with `release-macos`.

The build copies the native module and runtime dependencies into the Python package so `import Infernux` works directly from the active environment.

### Launch the Hub in development mode

```bash
conda activate infengine
python packaging/launcher.py
```

Development mode uses the current Python environment and local build outputs. It does not install the Hub's managed runtime.

### Run tests

```bash
conda activate infengine
cd python
python -m pytest test/ -v
```

## Documentation

- Website: <https://chenlizheme.github.io/Infernux/>
- Documentation hub: <https://chenlizheme.github.io/Infernux/wiki.html>
- Technical report: [Infernux: A Python-Native Game Engine with JIT-Accelerated Scripting (arXiv:2604.10263)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.10263)
- API reference: generated from the Python package and published under `docs/wiki/site/`

To regenerate the API markdown and static site locally:

```bash
conda activate infengine
python docs/wiki/generate_api_docs.py
python -m mkdocs build --clean -f docs/wiki/mkdocs.yml
```

Equivalent CMake targets are `generate_api_docs` and `build_wiki_html`.

## Packaging

Two distribution paths are currently supported for the Hub.

### Standalone bundle

```bash
cmake --build --preset packaging
```

This produces the portable PyInstaller output under `dist/Infernux Hub/`.

### Windows installer

```bash
cmake --build --preset packaging-installer
```

This produces the graphical Windows installer, which stages the matching Python 3.12 runtime for the host architecture and provisions project runtimes from that managed base.
